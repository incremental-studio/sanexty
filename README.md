# Sanexty

This is a template repository for bootstrapping your Next.js website, powered by Sanity CMS. There are some other opinionated defaults built in too.

This project is very new, and subject to change. When it's in a more stable place, I'll write out all the steps for setting up your own instance and deploying.
