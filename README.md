# Sanexty
---

> *Disclaimer:* This project is very new, and subject to change. When it’s in a more stable place, I’ll write out all the steps for setting up your own instance and deploying.

## Project Overview

Sanexty is a starter project for creating web apps with Next.js & Sanity CMS. There are some other opinionated defaults and dependencies built in too, but nothing is taken too far that you wouldn’t be able to rip things out without breaking other things. The ambition of this project is to make it easy to whip up a new web app, with helpful tools to make building out an initial version super quickly.

It’s similar to a typical bootstrap project in that it helps you get going, and gives you a lot of tools—but my main issue with those projects is that the initial template takes things too far, meaning if you want to make something custom and good, you need to spend a bunch of time up front ripping stuff out and deleting CSS. For me, that takes the joy out of it, because I never have as much excitement about a project as I do at the beginning—so if I can remove that stuff, without making it tedious to create the things I'm doing over and over, then hopefully it will be possible to turn that excitement into momentum.

It’s different from a "skeleton" project, in that it goes further than a basic folder structure. I’m making this for myself, and people like myself—designer-developer types that care chiefly about the user experience (and the developer experience). As any good UX person knows, that isn’t just about the design, but also about the structure, performance, maintainability, and consistency.

## Contributing

If you want to help me with this project, please do! Just fork it and issue a PR. Please keep them small and understandable. If you want to upgrade a bunch of things, do multiple PRs. If you’re not super comfortable with a git workflow, but have things to say, create an [issue](https://github.com/incremental-studio/sanexty/issues), or shoot me a message on [Twitter (@benjaminsehl)](https://twitter.com/benjaminsehl). 

I would be open to having ongoing maintainers contributing to this project too—but since it will aim to be my _main_ starter project for the things I’m working on, I’m super opinionated about it, so would like to chat to make sure we’re aligned on vision, shoot me a message on [twitter](https://twitter.com/benjaminsehl) if you’d like to get involved.
